# Maximum A Posteriori with Laplace Prior

Python script implementing a MAP machine learning algorithm for binary input/output data built upon a log likelihood estimation, Naive Bayes, and utilizes a Laplace prior for better stability

## Implementation

This code requires a "training file" which needs to be in the format of lists/rows of binary data. The last value in the row represents the overall outcome/label of all previous entries/paramaters in the respective row. Once the training is complete, a testing file can be used to determine the level of precision in which the code can predict future outcomes based on given new data.
